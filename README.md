# Prediction of Rainfall in Australia
In this project I have used various machine learning algorithms like:
1. linear regression
2. KNN
3. Decision tree
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM 
to predict rainfall in Australia. I have used metrics like MSE, MAE and R2 for Linear Regression and Accuracy score, score, jaccard index for classification algorithms. Also, I have used log loss to evaluate Logistic Regression model. I have used Scikit learn, pandas and numpy libraries of python for the same.
